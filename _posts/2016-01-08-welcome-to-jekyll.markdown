Ph.D. student in the Department of Earth Science Education at Pusan National University, located in Busan, Korea. I am interested in a broad range of research topics, such as geoheritage, geoscience education, astronomy and data science.


To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

``` ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
